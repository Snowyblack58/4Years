Biology 1	4310T1	1.0	0.50	Biology 1	9
TJHSST Description

The honors level freshman Biology course at TJHSST is molecular based introductory course with emphasis on chemistry for biology students, cell biology, bioenergetics, DNA science, evolution, ecology, and human anatomy and physiology. The course is designed with two purposes in mind. First, it provides the content and skills foundation for the entire scientific program at the school. In particular, the Biology curriculum prepares students for the Advance Placement (AP) Biology course. Second, the course represents one element of IBET that links these distinctive disciplines so that scientific concepts, language arts, and engineering innovation are seamlessly woven together in a way that is realistic and relevant to students. As such, the Biology course demonstrates cohesive horizontal articulation (including the constraints of the unique integrated project work done by each team) among the various Biology classes, while also targeting vertical articulation in support of upper-class courses. Each IBET team requires the development of a year-long research project designed and conducted by students in small groups. Collaboration is stressed to prepare students for increased demands by industry for strong interpersonal skills as well as technical competencies. The Fairfax County Public Schools Family Life Education (FLE) instruction occurs at the end of the school year. Upon completion of Biology 1, students will take the Virginia Biology standards of learning end-of-course test.

Description

In Biology 1 Honors, students engage in scientific inquiry as they explore biological processes. All class activities and laboratory activities focus on life processes that occur within organisms or cells as well as the characteristics of life including: reproduction, development, and adaptation to environment. Major topics of study include molecular biology, cells, genetics, organisms, evolution and ecology. In comparison to Biology 1, students will investigate some topics at a deeper level including biotechnology, health and environmental issues. Students will be involved in an externally-moderated experimental/research project, either independently or in teams. The course includes a unit on human life education that addresses the topics of human reproduction and human development. Parents have the option of withdrawing their child from any or all topics included in the state-mandated Family Life Education portion.

In terms of content, the course will explore the increasingly interconnected history of major civilizations and other forms of complex societies that arose in pre-classical through post-classical era Afro-Eurasia, focusing on comparative analysis of the sociopolitical, economic, religious, and cultural traditions and innovations that developed in these ancient societies as well as the webs of communication and exchange that connected these societies spatially and temporally. Investigations of cultural traditions will emphasize the development of scientific and technological breakthroughs and innovations, trace the means and routes by which they spread beyond the society in which they emerged, and the regional and cross-regional impact they wielded on the increasingly interconnected pre-modern world. In specific terms, the civilizations studied in the course will range from Mesopotamia and Egypt in the ancient world, to Greece, Rome, Persia, China, and India in the classical world, to the fall of Rome and the rise of the Islamic world in the early-post-classical world.
 
As a foundational course focusing on inquiry learning and the development of higher order thinking, reading, and writing skills, a heavy emphasis will be based on analyzing and evaluating various types of primary and secondary sources. The course will culminate with a final research project that will integrate these skills and focus on the larger themes of the course.

AP European History	239904	1.0	1.00	AP European Hist	10,11,12
TJHSST Description

The study of European history since 1450 introduces students to cultural, economic, political, and social developments that played a fundamental role in shaping the world in which they live. Without this knowledge, we would lack the context for understanding the development of contemporary institutions, the role of continuity and change in present-day society and politics, and the evolution of current forms of artistic expression and intellectual discourse. In addition to providing a basic narrative of events and movements, the goals of A.P. European History are to develop (a) an understanding of some of the principal themes in modern European history, (b) an ability to analyze historical evidence and historical interpretations, and (c) an ability to express historical understanding in writing. This course does not qualify for the 4th social studies credit.

Description

The Advanced Placement Program in European History covers the basic chronology of events from 1450 (the High Renaissance) to the present. Students are expected to demonstrate a knowledge of this basic chronology and of major events and trends in the intellectual cultural, political-diplomatic, and social-economic history of modern Europe. In addition, students are expected to demonstrate an ability to analyze historical evidence and to express that understanding and analysis in writing. This course prepares students to take the Advanced Placement examination in European History, for which college credit and/or placement is given if a qualifying score is achieved.

Economic Theory	2800T1	0.5	0.50	Economic Theory	10,11,12
TJHSST Description

Economics is the study of human behavior. This course provides students with an overview of economic theory and practice as it relates to their lives, their buying habits, and the overall health of the economy. Students will learn to think like an economist as they study the fundamental principles of economic theory such as supply and demand, the strengths and weaknesses of various economic systems, the role of the government in regulating business, and their roles as consumers and employees in the U.S. economy. While somewhat less rigorous than an A.P. Economics course, students will go beyond the level of a standard Economics survey course, and will learn and employ many of the mathematical and graphical analytic tools used in such courses.

Description

Students develop an understanding of economic principles and their applications by analyzing basic theories and concepts. They examine the role of both private financial institutions and the government in influencing the economy. They identify ways in which economic developments affect them as consumers and ways in which they as consumers affect the economic system. In some schools, students use outside business consultants, computer databases, simulations and curriculum materials developed by Junior Achievement, Inc.

Psychology: Mind, Body, & Behavior	2900T1	0.5	0.50	Psych: Brain& Beh	10,11,12
TJHSST Description

Psychology is the scientific study of behavior and mental processes. But everything psychological is simultaneously biological. Every thought, emotion and body movement has biological underpinnings. And yet, we are more than just a collection of neural networks. Our brains have consciousness. The brain seeks to understand itself. The brain somehow gives birth to the mind. TJ's psychology semester elective seeks to explore the connection between the brain and the mind. How important is the brain in shaping behavior? Why do we do what we do? Throughout the course, students will use approaches from a variety of psychological perspectives (social, developmental, evolutionary, cognitive, behavioral, psychoanalytic and biological) to explore this question.

Description

Students examine patterns and variations of human behavior and the process of individual human development. They identify and examine the emotional, intellectual, and physical factors which influence the development of the individual human being. Students distinguish among the major schools and systems of psychology and methods of investigation.

TJHSST Description

All too often, the forgotten part of history instruction is the history of our own lives. Students may be aware of great moments, events and trends from the Roman era, the Renaissance, and the Industrial Revolution but unaware or nominally aware of the end of the Cold War, the rise of the European Union or China as economic powers, or even domestic events such as the Republican Revolution. This course is designed to fill those gaps. While this is in large measure a history course, the curriculum may evolve depending on current events as they reflect trends of the last two decades. Nonetheless, subject areas will include the end of the Cold War and fall of the Soviet Union, the breakup and civil war in Yugoslavia, the rise of the European Union, China and East Asia as global powers, the rise of the left in Latin America, new developments in the Middle East, and politics in America in the 1980s and 1990s. The course will function as a readings seminar. In each unit, students will read, discuss, and present on articles from periodicals such as Current History, Foreign Affairs, Atlantic Monthly, and major newspapers. They will also spend a good deal of time simply becoming familiar with the geography of the areas to be studied, and the names of domestic and foreign leaders and thinkers.

Ancient & Classical Civilizations	TJA2361	1.0	0.50	Ancient Civ	9,10
Description

Ancient Civilizations will be an inquiry-based, in-depth course that will offer students an opportunity to investigate the history of the ancient world's major cultures from their beginning to their decline in the post-classical era from an interdisciplinary perspective. Offered as an elective option aimed at 9th and 10th graders to complete their 4th social studies credit, the course will serve as a foundational course that purports to introduce students to research and analytical skills needed in the upper level courses.
 
In terms of content, the course will explore the increasingly interconnected history of major civilizations and other forms of complex societies that arose in pre-classical through post-classical era Afro-Eurasia, focusing on comparative analysis of the sociopolitical, economic, religious, and cultural traditions and innovations that developed in these ancient societies as well as the webs of communication and exchange that connected these societies spatially and temporally. Investigations of cultural traditions will emphasize the development of scientific and technological breakthroughs and innovations, trace the means and routes by which they spread beyond the society in which they emerged, and the regional and cross-regional impact they wielded on the increasingly interconnected pre-modern world. In specific terms, the civilizations studied in the course will range from Mesopotamia and Egypt in the ancient world, to Greece, Rome, Persia, China, and India in the classical world, to the fall of Rome and the rise of the Islamic world in the early-post-classical world.
 
As a foundational course focusing on inquiry learning and the development of higher order thinking, reading, and writing skills, a heavy emphasis will be based on analyzing and evaluating various types of primary and secondary sources. The course will culminate with a final research project that will integrate these skills and focus on the larger themes of the course.

America and the World Since 1989	TJA2996	0.5	0.50	Am/Wrld Since 1989	10,11,12
TJHSST Description

All too often, the forgotten part of history instruction is the history of our own lives. Students may be aware of great moments, events and trends from the Roman era, the Renaissance, and the Industrial Revolution but unaware or nominally aware of the end of the Cold War, the rise of the European Union or China as economic powers, or even domestic events such as the Republican Revolution. This course is designed to fill those gaps. While this is in large measure a history course, the curriculum may evolve depending on current events as they reflect trends of the last two decades. Nonetheless, subject areas will include the end of the Cold War and fall of the Soviet Union, the breakup and civil war in Yugoslavia, the rise of the European Union, China and East Asia as global powers, the rise of the left in Latin America, new developments in the Middle East, and politics in America in the 1980s and 1990s. The course will function as a readings seminar. In each unit, students will read, discuss, and present on articles from periodicals such as Current History, Foreign Affairs, Atlantic Monthly, and major newspapers. They will also spend a good deal of time simply becoming familiar with the geography of the areas to be studied, and the names of domestic and foreign leaders and thinkers.

Specialized Computer Assisted Design	9828T2	0.5	0.50	Spec Comp Asst Des	10,11,12
TJHSST Description

The CAD course is the culmination of a long history of graphical representation of the spatial problem-solving process. This is taught within the context of the Autodesk program Inventor. Unlike previous CAD programs such as AutoCAD, Inventor is a parametric CAD program. What that means is the dimensions, shape, and other key factors in the design are controlled by variables which can be changed at any time, even after the design is complete. In effect, when you design an object in a parametric CAD program you are creating not one design but a whole family of related designs. In the simplest example one can draw a hexagonal nut, change two dimensions and a hole parameter and it will become any hexagonal nut. Change another parameter and it will become a square nut. For increased complexity one can design a generic internal combustion engine.

Description

Students develop basic skills in drawing and study careers related to drafting through the use of Computer-Assisted Drafting (CAD) and other software applications to gain an understanding of the technical drawing processes.
