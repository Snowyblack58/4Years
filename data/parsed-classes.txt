Separate grades are awarded for each course. The goal of the ninth-grade English program is to expose students to various forms of literature that will encourage them to make discoveries about themselves and the world around them. Through studying models of many genres, students sharpen their writing skills by producing their own analytic, creative, and scientific work. Students experience the processes used in writing, working in groups, reading, listening, speaking, and viewing. In each of these areas, they examine their experiences and knowledge. They produce cumulative projects often in the form of class presentations and performances. Components of the course include use of writing logs, participation in book talks, literary discussion groups, writing workshops, and groups formed for special projects.\r===Description\r===English 9 Honors deepens and advances the curriculum of English 9.

In effect, when you design an object in a parametric CAD program you are creating not one design but a whole family of related designs.
